## SQL Murder Mystery

### Overview
The SQL Murder Mystery is a game where you use SQL to solve a fictional murder that occurred in **SQL City** on **January 15, 2018**. This interactive exercise helps you practice SQL queries while unraveling the mystery.

### Objectives

SELECT * 
FROM crime_scene_report 
WHERE type = 'murder' AND date = '20180115' AND city = 'SQL City';
```

#### Investigate witnesses
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM person 
WHERE address_street_name IN ('Northwestern Dr', 'Franklin Ave');
```

#### Analyze gym check-ins and memberships
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM get_fit_now_member 
WHERE id = '48Z55';
